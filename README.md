👋 Hi, I’m Marcia!
👀 I’m interested in learning all Front-End things, but I'm a curious one! So you'll often see me roaming in through the Full-Stack lane.
🌱 I’m currently learning Java (POO) and JavaScript
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects, and anything that I can learn from I consider it to be a fun one
